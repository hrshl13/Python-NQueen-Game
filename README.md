# Python-NQueen-Game
This is a program developed in Python.

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

I have tried to replicate that in Python. Python console will is used to play this game. 
You enter the respective row and column number to where you wouldplace your queen. Where the queens are represented as 1s and the rest as 0s, in a matrix board.
It's a fun game where I have used colored text on a console.
